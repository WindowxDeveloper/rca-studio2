RCA Studio II and Studio III Home TV Programmer Emulator

It is also known as the RCA Studio 2 and Studio 3 game console.

This code is based on work by Paul Robson, 
who wrote a RCA COSMAC CDP1802 microcomputer and Studio 2 emulator.

I converted his well-crafted C code to the Processing language (Java) and I added
emulation for the Studio III game console color graphics and sound. Robson's emulation
is excellent because it simulates the real-time operaton of the Studio 2 quite well. 
You will need to download the Processing SDK to run the emulated games. 
I chose Processing/Java so that the code can be ported or generated for Windows, Apple IOS, Linux, Android, and Web JavaScript.

This respository is intended for educational and historic use to show how the games looked and worked. 
With Studio 3 emulation you can see a color version of some games, not available anywhere else that I know about.
