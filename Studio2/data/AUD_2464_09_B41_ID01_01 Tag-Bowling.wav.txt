BOWL/TAG GAME

Programmed by Joe Weisbecker 

Instructions For the RCA COSMAC Computer
Game System by Joe Weisbecker, January 1975

Normally you put in 25 cents to play.

Press 1 or 2 on the A side of the switch box 
to select the tag or the bowling game.

The tag game assigns moving arrows to two
players who can then chase each other around
the TV screen by pressing their direction switches.

Catching the other players arrow before he catches
you gives you one point. The game ends after 
several minutes and you must put in another 
quarter to play again.

The bowling game lets two players compete at
a simple, simulated, TV bowling alley.
Button 3 rolls the ball.
Button 2 and 4 let you move the ball up or 
down after you've rolled.

This game ends after 6 frames have been played.
